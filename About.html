   <h3>About</h3>

    <p>J.K. Williams Seafood & Steak was started by our very own, world renonwned in-house chef, <b>Kevin Williams</b>. Born and raised in <b>Brookyln, New York</b>, his desire to pursue unknown flavor combinations has pushed him to become one of the most prominent chefs of our generation. Being a first generation American with a Jamaican background, he moved out of his parents home at an early age with the idea in mind that he wanted to elevate his cooking ability to the finest level imaginable. Within his few years of stepping out into the culinary scene, he's accumulated many different accolades over the years to showcase all of his efforts.</p>
  
   <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
  
    <p>Over the years, J.K. Williams has strived time and time again to provide people with an incredible dining experience. From the food, to the personally curated playlists, to the personalities you're greeted with as you enter, J.K. Williams has devoted his life to excellent service and immaculate taste to provide an evening like no other.</p>

  <p>Here at J.K. Williams Seafood & Steak, we personally believe that the freshest ingredients are the best ingredients. Since 2016 we have sourced all of our beef from Creekstone Farms based in Arkansas City, Kansas. Where as just recently in 2018, we began to source our seafood from Pike's Place Market located in Seattle, Washington. Our mission is to bring forth a level of flavor and comfort that are unmatched to any dining facility you've visited before.</p>

    <p>Every month our chef curates a new playlist for the restaurant's theme, and will add new dishes to the menu that embody the sounds of his monthly choosings. Not only adding to the environment, but providing a sense of excitement within the establishment that culinary lovers, and our musically inclined guests will cherish for their entire lives.</p>
